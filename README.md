### Deleting a Codespace üóëÔ∏è

**Deleting a codespace will delete all files and folders therein.** If you are
sure you want to delete a codespace:

1. Visit [code.cs50.io/codespaces](https://code.cs50.io/codespaces).
2. Under Your codespaces, to the right of `main`, click ‚Ä¶, select **Delete**,
   and click **OK**.

You can then create a new codespace by logging back into code.cs50.io.

## üåµ Git and Visual Studio Code for CS50

> [cs50.readthedocs.io/code/#git](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/code/#git)

Because a codespace is already associated with a Git repository in CS50‚Äôs
code50 organisation at https://github.com/code50, which is used for automated
backups, CS50 effectively disables git anytime you‚Äôre inside of
`/workspaces/ID` (which is a codespace‚Äôs default directory).

However, you can still use git outside of that directory, such as by cloning
other repositories into /workspaces itself.

## Using Git with Visual Studio Code for CS50

### Symbolic links and Git üîó

A symbolic link is a file that points to another file or directory. When
accessed, it redirects to the file or directory it points to. It acts like a
shortcut or alias.

1. Change directory to `/workspaces` so that you can use Git

   ```bash
   $ cd /workspaces
   ```

2. Now you can execute

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git
   ```

3. Create the symbolic link

   ```bash
   $ ln -s /workspaces/REPO /workspaces/ID
   ```

   where

   `/workspaces/REPO` is the "target" directory; the symbolic link will point here

   `/workspaces/ID` is the "source" directory; will contain the symbolic link named `REPO`

Now you can use Git outside of the `/workspaces/ID` directory to operate on
your repository, and because of your symbolic link, the same files work with
the frontend of Visual Studio Code for CS50:

- Will be automatically backed up to CS50‚Äôs code50 organisation (only
  `/workspaces/ID` will be automatically backed up)
- Will be visible in the explorer pane of Visual Studio Code
